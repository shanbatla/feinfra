## Toli (Shameless Plug ðŸ˜‰)

FE Infra Book was start by Anatoliy (Toli) Zaslavskiy with the intention of helping other FE architects with system design interviews and to eventually collaborate on the best strategies for building beautiful, scalable apps. And maybe to impress employers ðŸ™ƒ.

Toli is a FE architect with 12y of experience. He started his career in enterprise backends (Federal Reserve Bank, WSJ, Amex), but eventually moved to the startup world. Now he is transitioning to big tech. His passion lies in architecting scalable frontend tools and empowering FE teams to grow!

### Personal Story

At 17 I was diagnosed with Aspergers. 5 years later, with Bipolar Disorder. Learning to navigate both was quite a challenging journey. But through that journey I learned important lessons that guide my engineering philosophy. Mental health is not a binary diagnosis. It affects every single person. Every engineer is unique, with their own strengths, weaknesses, passions, needs, and motivations. Engineers work best when they are in flow, interally and with each other. Iâ€™ve personally witnessed, the radical effects on teams that optimize for creating flow. This understanding led me to my finding my passion â€” laying the technical groundwork for a productive, inclusive, and fun environment, by engineering the tooling and infrastructure that the whole team can build upon, allowing them to focus on what they do best, avoiding boilerplate and solving the same common problems. Enabling engineers to do what they enjoy is the key to achieving flow. Even more importantly, I enjoy fostering a team culture where egos can truly be dropped, creating states of flow where feedback is seen as just that - feedback, a mechanism to help each other, the product, and company grow. It is my passion, specialty, and mission, not just to write instrastructural frontend code, but to mentor, pair program with, and scale frontend teams.
