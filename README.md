# Why I Wrote This Guide

I wrote this guide while interviewing for a few big tech companies. Namely, Dropbox and Square. I was up for some architectural Frontend Roles, where Systems Design interviews are the deciding factor for getting the job.

I tried searching for some videos, but most examples were for Backend/Distributed System problems.

So I had to piece together some knowledge I had from my career, asked a few folks to help out, and did a few mock interviews.&#x20;

I decided to release this as open source, because us FE folks need some love too!!! Feel free to make PRs and [contribute](https://github.com/tolicodes/feinfra)!
